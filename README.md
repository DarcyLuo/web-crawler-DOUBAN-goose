This project is show how to grab information of DOUBAN posts during WUHAN chronovirus period

Wuhan Chronovirus has been spread worldwide and has raised heat public discussion on related issues such as the influence on prices, the shorthand of medical resources and so on. 
We are interested in the public attitude towards this worldwide event and we are also interested how public attitude changes as time passed by.
In this case, this project chooses one of the most popular and influential groups of the social media --- DOUBAN and grabs the TOP 250 topics of posts, authors and their post dates to track how public attitutes change from February to March. 

As DOUBAN limits web crawler codes to only 250 posts every day, I will use these codes to track the TOP 250 topics every day from February to March to get at least 5000 posts information and then use NLP technology to to sentiment analysis on the dataset.
